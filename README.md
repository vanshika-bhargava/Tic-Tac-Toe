Its a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.<br>
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.<br>
It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.<br><br>

This game is made using the C programming language. It is played between the user and the computer.<br>
The program asks for the row and column which you want to mark and then the computer marks some other block randomly. This sequence of activity is continued till either of them wins or there are no spaces left
